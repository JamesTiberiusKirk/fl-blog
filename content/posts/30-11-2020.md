Yesterday I did not get the chance to properly setup a kafka connection with typescript. I kept encountering problems, laster on even was getting some tsc build problems with kafka-nodes source. Upon closer inspection, kafka-node has not been maintained for at least a year. Because of that I decided to switch away and to kafkajs, it seems to still be in development and also has builtin types which I can just read. I guess that it the price to pay for not using an "officially supported language" and having to rely on community libraries.
