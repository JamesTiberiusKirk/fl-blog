Service meshes and Linkerd specifically seems to be nice and really useful. However, at the moment I will not be using it because I have not even started to use Kubernates. The nice part is that all of this is just setting up the proxies on the k8s cluster and no need to do anything in code. I will definitely be coming back to this at a later stage.

My next step will be to look into Kubernates, just not sure if I should do that before or after I have code running or not.

Meanwhile I can think about how to structure the project. Since I will have multiple code-bases, I most likely have some commonly shared code; stuff like custom data structures, maybe some generic libraries for interfacing with databases, etc. I am wanting to make a separate 'shared' node modules project which will be imported into all the services. Will just need to look into any conventions of how this would be done. However fow now this might not actually be needed.
