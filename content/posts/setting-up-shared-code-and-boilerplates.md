So I have finally stated to setup the boilerplate code which will be used in this project's shared code. So far I am just looking at setting up the base npm mopdule with one placeholder function. My plan is also setup and use GitHub's package system which allows you to publish npm packages.

The few things I would like to setup for this sub project would be:
- Unit tests
- Typescript
- JSDoc (or some typescript alternative)
- CI/CD with github actions
- Versioning

# Unit Testing
For this I will just be using mocha and chai.

# Documentation
I will be following the typescript documentation standard from Microsoft. However, I will, for now, not be generation any documentation from it. Ideally I would like to just output the docs to the README of the project or a neighboring markdown document. I have managed to compile markdown using jsdoc2md package, however, this will not provide any ts typings. For now I will just stick to just commenting the code properly, and someday I will comeback and figure out a way to compile markdown out of the comments.


# Versioning


# off the cuff notes (to be re-written)
- it was a pain to set up the ci-cd for the shared code
- need to figure out versioning
    - for now i am doing it manually by upping the number in package.json
- also linking module locally is very easy
```bash
npm link #inside fl-shared
npm link @jamestiberiuskirk/fl-shared #inside the services which need to consume it
```
    - I have however made npm scripts to automate this
