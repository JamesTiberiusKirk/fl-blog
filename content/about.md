Hi, my name is Dumitru Vulpe. This blog is for cataloging my journey through developing my 4th year (at university) honours project. The honours project consists of a frontend app for logging workouts and a micro-services based backend.

The challenge for me here is to learn how to create a backend which utilizes micro-services. So far my knowledge consists of just general full stack web development. I have not done any serious mobile development (apart from using Ionic for an internship) and I only knew some basic micro-services concepts and did not have any prior knowledge of technologies to be used.

So this blog is just meant to be a timeline of my journey and a good way to log all my steps which will come in useful for the final report.
